The AICV Lab aims to advance research in **computer vision**, **robotics**, and **medical imaging**. Over the past few years, we have made significant progress in these fields through our cutting-edge research and collaboration with leading experts in the field. Our work has resulted in numerous publications in top-tier conferences and journals, and we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with our advanced machine learning techniques, particularly in the areas of deep neural networks. We are excited to continue our research and contribute to the field of computer vision, robotics, and medical imaging.
