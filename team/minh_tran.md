### Overview
I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Arkansas, advised by Dr. Ngan Le. 

My research interests are deep learning algorithms for visual perception tasks (object detection, segmentation, pose estimation, etc.) and path/motion planning regarding visual perception.

My current works mainly explore deep learning algorithms for semantic and instance segmentation tasks in images and videos.

### Education
- BSc, Computer Science, University of Science, VNU-HCM (2020)
