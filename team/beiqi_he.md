### Overview
I am a doctoral researcher in the field of Biomedical Engineering at Hainan University,  pursuing my Ph.D. under the mentorship of Professor Ying Han. 

The core of my research focuses on analyzing the phenotypic characteristics of gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease, with the overarching goal of uncovering the key mechanisms that regulate the molecular signaling of the microbiota-gut-brain axis during the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. By leveraging integrative genomics and metagenomic stratification techniques, I am committed to identifying the pathogenic microbial signatures that may induce or exacerbate neuropathological damage.

Beyond laboratory work, I dedicate my energy to regular strength training and exploratory outdoor activities.
