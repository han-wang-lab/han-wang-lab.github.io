### Academic Profile

I am a Ph.D. student in Biomedical Engineering at Hainan University, supervised by Prof. Ying Han. My research focuses on bridging data science and medical technology, with a strong emphasis on solving practical problems in biomedical engineering through advanced analytical methods.

### Research Interests

My core research directions revolve around the intersection of big data analytics and medical image analysis, specifically including:
- Medical image segmentation: Developing and optimizing algorithms to accurately segment anatomical structures, lesions, or functional regions from medical imaging data (e.g., CT, MRI, ultrasound), which supports clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and efficacy evaluation.
- Multi-omics data integration analysis: Exploring approaches to fuse multi-dimensional biological data (such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and imaging omics) to uncover potential biomarkers, understand disease mechanisms, and facilitate personalized medicine research.
