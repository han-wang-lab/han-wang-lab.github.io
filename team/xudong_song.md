### Overview
I am a Ph.D. student in Biomedical Engineering at Hainan University, supervised by Dr. Hao Wang.

My research interests are deep learning algorithms for visual perception tasks (such as object detection, segmentation, pose estimation, etc.) and path/motion planning related to visual perception.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing board games and reading detective novels. Feel free to reach out if you want to play together!
